# Adam-project-1

upon reflection of my first assignment i feel as though i have definetly learnt a lot this week, being able to build and code a website is'nt something i've done before and im happy with the work the i have produced for this first assignment. I've had fun building and positioning aspects of the page so that it responds well and looks clean to the user. I feel as though i've really built an understanding of the basics of html and css in terms of implementing images to the page, aligning text ontop of the image, using divs, headers and footers and placing audio into my website. One area though that i do really need to work on is flex-box, i've used this throughout my website but feel on the last page i struggled to align the anchor tag. I plan on continuing my further reading on this subject so that next time im able to position items on the web page with ease. I really enjoyed this project and feel as though i've already come a long way from when i started at the begining of the week and look forward to continuing my learning and improving my confidence is coding.
